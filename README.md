# Backlash Compensation Layer Shift Fix Branch
- Resolves Backlash Compensation Layer Shift issue #2
- Also has Input Shaping and Host Action Commands enabled per #13. This shouldn't cause issues if you're not using either feature, but let me know if you think it does.
- Input Shaping and Backlash Compensation are set to 0 by default. Use the relevant M commands on your start G-code to activate.
